19:11:59 [WARNING] [LuckPerms] LuckPerms already has data for player 'looking4games' - but this data is stored under a different UUID.
19:11:59 [WARNING] [LuckPerms] 'looking4games' has previously used the unique ids [9bf2a2ef-9112-3ba0-a7b9-46837ee96dc6] but is now connecting with '4f057146-4763-41cb-9280-cd611c822305'
19:11:59 [WARNING] [LuckPerms] The UUID the player is connecting with now is Mojang-assigned (type 4). This implies that BungeeCord's IP-Forwarding has not been setup correctly on one (or more) of the backend servers.
19:11:59 [WARNING] [LuckPerms] The UUID the player is connecting with now is Mojang-assigned (type 4). This implies that one of the other servers in your network is not authenticating correctly.
